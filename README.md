A collection of My Data Science and MAchine Learning Project

## Contents
* ### Machine Learning Project
1. [ML Project](https://github.com/Folu22/Data-Visualization/blob/main/ML%20PROJECT.ipynb)

In this project, we use time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.
Specifically, we build a linear regression model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.

2. [CO2 Emission project](https://github.com/Folu22/Data-Visualization/blob/main/CO2%20emission%20-%20machine%20learning%20completed%20.ipynb)

In this project we predicted the amount of co2 emission that is to be emitted from a car engine given the explanatory variables.

* ### Data-Visualization
[Data Visualization of a Sales data.](https://github.com/Folu22/Data-Visualization/blob/main/sales-data-viz.ipynb)

This project is a data analysis project, this project contains certain questions answered through visualiztion.
